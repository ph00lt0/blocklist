# Blocklists for AdGuard Home, AdGuard, Little Snitch, Open Snitch, uBlock Origin, Brave Adblock, pfBlockerNG, and PiHole

Blocklist of analytics and annoyances found by our own research (either discovery or found by collecting sources). The trackers listed by DDG contain a lot of false postives, which we try to whitelist to the best of our ability. This blocklists aims at not breaking the exerpience of apps, if this occurs please report so.

We recommend against using the AdGuard DNS filter, they whitellist many tracking domains using @@ which overwrite your settings in the name of functionality. They allow for trackers in emails links and page ads in search results, something we do not compromise for.

This blocklists aims at blocking:
- Stats and analytics (including privacy preserving ones such as Matomo) 
- Lottery and gambling companies
- Data brokers and data collecting companies such as surveys
- Debugging trackers
- Ads
- Font content delivery networks
- Consent/cookie management platforms
- Malware
- Spyware
- Remote Desktop Software
- Scam and fraud
- Phishing attempts
- Domains used in email spam activity
<br>

Depending on where the list is used it will also block:
- Cookie banners
- Overflow blocking css
- Ad loading scripts
- Fingerprinting scripts
- Tracking scripts and pixels
- Analytical scripts
- Newsletter scripts
- Affliation scripts
- Tracking parameters
- Affiliation parameters

<br>

Recommended is to use uBlock Origin as it makes best use of the filters, as not all filters are supported by the other tools. 

For home DNS resolving Adguard Home is superior in its functionality over PiHole.
